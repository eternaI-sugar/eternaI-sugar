${\textsf{\color{#3365f9}My name is Simon, a transgender male so please proceed with addressing my pronouns as he/him as that is the pronoun I am the most comfortable with.} }$

${\textsf{\color{#3365f9}I'm not that active on pony town as I used to be but I tend to only be on when my friends want me to so you may not see me often.} }$

${\textsf{\color{#3365f9}I do not want nor wish to be added on random occasions as these requests will be denied half-heartedly.} }$

${\textsf{\color{#3365f9}If you do so happen to converse with me, us being friends may turn out unlikely as I lose social battery quickly and I am a very selective person with my friends. I do not wish nor want to encourage to upset you at all! I only ask of you to not be mad if I run off to another foe I'm closer with so do 𝙄𝙉𝙏𝙀𝙍𝘼𝘾𝙏 𝙒𝙄𝙏𝙃 𝘾𝘼𝙐𝙏𝙄𝙊𝙉 if you wish to befriend me.} }$
