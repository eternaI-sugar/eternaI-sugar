My name is Simon, a transgender male so please proceed with addressing my pronouns as he/him for it is the pronoun I am the most comfortable with.

I'm not that active on pony town as I used to be but I tend to only be on when my friends want me to so you may not see me often.

I do not want nor wish to be added on random occasions as these requests will be denied half-heartedly. This applies to sudden friend requests from people I don't know.

ALWAYS interact with caution because I tend to lose social battery quickly around strangers and struggle to converse with many others. I am a very selective person with my friends, I do not wish nor want to upset you but I have a tendency to prefer the people I'm most comfortable with! I do not ask much from you, please do not be angry or mad if I flee to another friend I'm closer with.

Basic DNI and I block freely. Do not be weird or you'll be blocked permanently.
